## CHATGPT SUMMARY
🧀 Dylan — The Cheese Coder

mombox 2022 survivor • AI enjoyer • game dev chaos gremlin

Hey! I’m Dylan, some kind of coder-thing wandering GitHub with grilled cheese in one hand and questionable ideas in the other.
I make games, poke at AI stuff, break my own projects, and then pretend it was intentional.

🔧 What I’m Working On

probably nothing

possibly something

depends on how much cheese I’ve eaten

if a repo appears, just assume it spawned itself

👾 About Me

random coder who likes AI

gamer with too many ideas

accidentally makes cool stuff sometimes

creator of weird Dylan-lore universes

immune to logic, weak to grilled cheese

🧠 Skills (kinda)

writing code and instantly regretting it

smashing bugs with “why does this exist” energy

forgetting what I was doing mid-sentence

pressing Ctrl+S like my life depends on it

6

7 (NO. STOP.)

🌀 Fun Facts

yes I like cheese

yes I make games

yes I break them too

no I have no idea what I’m doing but it works anyway

📫 Contact Me

Send help. Or cheese. Either one works.
